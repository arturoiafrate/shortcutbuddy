# ShortcutBuddy

## What is ShortcutBuddy?
ShortcutBuddy is a simple java application that allows you to create and manage keyboard shortcuts for your favorite applications. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it a great tool for anyone who wants to improve their productivity.
It comes with a preset of default shortcuts for popular applications, but you can also create your own custom shortcuts to suit your needs.
It's a Windows application only, it will not work on Linux or MacOS.

## How to use ShortcutBuddy
- Start the application, it will leave a tray icon in the system tray.
- Hold the `Ctrl` key and ShortcutBuddy will intercept the foreground window and show a popup with the available shortcuts for that application.
- Release the `Ctrl` key and the popup will disappear.
- Hold the `Ctrl` key and press the `.` key to start typing. The shortcuts will be filtered based on the text you type. Press `Esc` key to close the popup.

## How to add your own shortcuts
At the application first run, ShortcutBuddy will create a folder in the user's home directory called `.shortcutbuddy`. Inside this folder, you can create a file called `usershortcuts.json` where you can add your own shortcuts.
Inside the same directory you can also find:
- `shortcuts.json`: The default shortcuts for popular applications. Do not edit this file, it will be overwritten when the application is updated.
- `settings.json`: The application settings. Don't manually edit this file, you can adjust the settings from the application GUI.
- `appimages` folder: The application images.

The `usershortcuts.json` file should be in the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "appName": "idea64.exe",
    "appDescription": "IntelliJ IDEA",
    "shortcuts": [
      {
        "shortcut": "Ctrl+Shift+N",
        "description": "Find file"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
## Roadmap
- [ ] Add a GUI to manage user defined shortcuts.
- [ ] Sort the shortcuts by the usage frequency.
